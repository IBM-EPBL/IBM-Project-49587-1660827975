Exercises
Answer the questions or complete the tasks outlined in bold below, use the specific method described if applicable.

** What is 7 to the power of 4?**

print(7**4);
2401
** Split this string:**

s = "Hi there Sam!"

into a list.

s="Hi there Sam!"
s=s.split()
print(s);
['Hi', 'there', 'Sam!']
 
['Hi', 'there', 'dad!']
** Given the variables:**

planet = "Earth"
diameter = 12742

** Use .format() to print the following string: **

The diameter of Earth is 12742 kilometers.
planet = "Earth"
diameter = 12742
planet = "Earth"
diameter = 12742
print( 'The diameter of {} is {} kilometers.' .format(planet,diameter));
The diameter of Earth is 12742 kilometers.
** Given this nested list, use indexing to grab the word "hello" **

lst = [1,2,[3,4],[5,[100,200,['hello']],23,11],1,7]
lst = [1,2,[3,4],[5,[100,200,['hello']],23,11],1,7]
a=lst[3][1][2];
print(a)
['hello']
** Given this nest dictionary grab the word "hello". Be prepared, this will be annoying/tricky **

d = {'k1':[1,2,3,{'tricky':['oh','man','inception',{'target':[1,2,3,'hello']}]}]}
d = {'k1':[1,2,3,{'tricky':['oh','man','inception',{'target':[1,2,3,'hello']}]}]}
print(d['k1'][3]["tricky"][3]['target'][3])
hello
** What is the main difference between a tuple and a list? **

# Tuple is immutable
#Tuples operations are safe.
#Tuples consumes less memory
** Create a function that grabs the email website domain from a string in the form: **

user@domain.com

So for example, passing "user@domain.com" would return: domain.com

def domainGet(email):
    print("'"+email.split('@')[-1]+"'")

email = input()
domainGet(email)
user@domain.com
'domain.com'
domainGet('user@domain.com')
'domain.com'
** Create a basic function that returns True if the word 'dog' is contained in the input string. Don't worry about edge cases like a punctuation being attached to the word dog, but do account for capitalization. **

def findDog(st):
    if 'dog' in st.lower():
        print("True")
    else:
        print("False")

st = "Is there a dog here?"
findDog(st)
True
findDog('Is there a dog here?')
True
** Create a function that counts the number of times the word "dog" occurs in a string. Again ignore edge cases. **

value = 'This dog runs faster than the other dog dude!';

def countdogs(value):
    count = 0
    for word in value.lower().split():
        if word == 'dog' or word == 'dogs':
            count = count + 1
            print(count)

countdogs(value)

seq = ['soup','dog','salad','cat','great']
seq = ['soup','dog','salad','cat','great']
list(filter(lambda word: word[0]!='s',seq))
['dog', 'cat', 'great']
Problem
You are driving a little too fast, and a police officer stops you. Write a function to return one of 3 possible results: "No ticket", "Small ticket", or "Big Ticket". If your speed is 60 or less, the result is "No Ticket". If speed is between 61 and 80 inclusive, the result is "Small Ticket". If speed is 81 or more, the result is "Big Ticket". Unless it is your birthday (encoded as a boolean value in the parameters of the function) -- on your birthday, your speed can be 5 higher in all cases.

def caught_speeding(speed, is_birthday):
    
    if is_birthday:
        speeding = speed - 5
    else:
        speeding = speed
    
    if speeding > 80:
        return 'Big Ticket'
    elif speeding > 60:
        return 'Small Ticket'
    else:
        return 'No Ticket'
def caught_speeding(speed, is_birthday):
    pass
caught_speeding(81,True)
Create an employee list with basic salary values(at least 5 values for 5 employees) and using a for loop retreive each employee salary and calculate total salary expenditure.

salary=[20000,15000,10000,8000,7000]
for i in salary:
  print(i)
print("the total salary expenditure:")
print(sum(salary))
20000
15000
10000
8000
7000
the total salary expenditure:
60000
Create two dictionaries in Python:

First one to contain fields as Empid, Empname, Basicpay

Second dictionary to contain fields as DeptName, DeptId.

Combine both dictionaries.

test_dict1 = {"Gfg" : 20, "is" : 36, "best" : 100}
test_dict2 = {"Gfg2" : 26, "is2" : 19, "best2" : 70}
  

print("The original dictionary 1 is : " + str(test_dict1))
print("The original dictionary 2 is : " + str(test_dict2))
  

keys1 = list(test_dict1.keys())
vals2 = list(test_dict2.values())
  

res = dict()
for idx in range(len(keys1)):
    res[keys1[idx]] = vals2[idx]
      

print("Mapped dictionary : " + str(res)) 
The original dictionary 1 is : {'Gfg': 20, 'is': 36, 'best': 100}
The original dictionary 2 is : {'Gfg2': 26, 'is2': 19, 'best2': 70}
Mapped dictionary : {'Gfg': 26, 'is': 19, 'best': 70}
